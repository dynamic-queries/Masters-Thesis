\textbf{Link}: \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09003}{End to End Symmetry - Zhang} 

The ideas from the paper are summarized, fallbacks in the model identified
and suggestions provided. 

\subsubsection{Problem Statement}
The paper seeks a "descriptor" aka feature representation to the configuration of a 
molecule that preserves Isometric (Translation and Rotation) and Permutation invariant
properties. 

\subsubsection{Idea}
Machine Learning Potentials modelled using Neural Networks are commonplace today.
A descriptor that could be represented using a Neural Network is sought after.
Ideas from Spherical CNNs and DeepSets are borrowed for realizing this.

\subsubsection{Math (not really)}

Let $r \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ and $y \in \mathbb{B}$ be the position and label of an atom in the molecule.

\begin{align*}
    F(r,y) := U_{f}U_{p}P_{s}T_{s}R_{s} L(r,y) 
\end{align*}

where \\ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $U_{f}$ : Operator computing the forces from Potential $U(r)$
    \item $U_{p}$ : Operator computing Potential $U(r)$ from the descriptor $D := P_{s}T_{s}R_{s}$.
    \item $P_{s}$ : Symmetry under permutation Operator
    \item $T_{s}$ : Symmetry under Translation Operator
    \item $R_{s}$ : Symmetry under Rotation Operator
    \item $L$ : Is the Lookup map from $(r,y)$ to the intial state of the descriptor $D_{init}$
\end{itemize}
